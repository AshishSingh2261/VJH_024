{Rice Case Worm(Insect)

Symptoms

• Leaves cut at right angles.

•Ladder-like structures.

• Larvae is green with yellow head.

• Adults are white moths.

The young P. stagnalis larva causes linear grazing of leaves.
Rice case worms cut off rice leaves tips at right angles to make leaf cases.
Caseworm damage is characterized by leaves cut at right angles as with a pair of scissors and leaf cases floating on 
water. 
Larvae feed by scraping the leaf tissue, leaving the papery upper layer of the leaf. Leaves that were fed upon are also 
left with ladder-like structures of hard fibers. 
Damage symptoms can be confused with other defoliating insect pests. 
To confirm caseworm, visually inspect: first, the ladder-like leaf tissues; second, cut leaves; and third, 
the presence of leaf cases attached onto leaf sheaths and floating in the water.

Preventive Measures

Early planting reduces the incidence.

• Use wider spacing (30 x 20 cm) when planting. • Transplant older seedlings and destroy

possible remaining eggs.

• Drain the field and use filters to catch worms when re-irrigating after 2-3 days.

• Use recommended fertilizer applications, avoiding excess application.

• Remove weeds and weedy rice in the field and nearby areas to remove alternate hosts.

• Make sure that adequate potassium is used.

Treatment

We recommend following organic control methods in the early stages of a disease or when the crop is close to harvesting.
In more advanced stages of a disease, please follow

chemical control measures. Mixing or applying different products at the same time is not recommended.

Organic Control

Encourage biological control agents such as snails (feed on eggs), hydrophilid and dytiscid water beetles 
(feed on larvae), spiders, dragonflies, and birds (feed on adults). 
Apply ash or spray neem leaf extracts to the place where insects are found.

Chemical Control

Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. 
Use foliar treatments of authorized carbamate insecticides and avoid pyrethroids, to which the pest has become tolerant.

What caused it?

The insect is most likely to be found in rice fields with standing water, in both wetland and irrigated environments. 
It survives on weeds and weedy rice in the field and nearby areas and infects new rice crops when the conditions are 
favorable. 
Transplanting young seedlings also favors the development of the insect. Poor preparatory cultivation and soils having 
deficiency in Zinc will predispose the crop to this disease. 
However, despite all of this, the insect is commonly found in rice fields in low populations.

Short horned grasshopper and locust(Insect)
Symptoms

• Shiny greenish color and 5 mm to 11 cm long.

• Feeding marks (cut out) on leaves, shoots,

and panicles.

- Adults swarm and migrate.

Symptoms differ depending on the plant type and the hunger of the grasshopper. 
Grasshopper and locust feed primarily on leaves damaging the margins or cutting out large portions of the leaf. 
Grains, seed pods and fruits may also be attacked by the insect. When they are very hungry they might even feed on stems 
and bark. 
They also nibble at the shoots, hence severing the reproductive parts.

Preventive Measures

• At planting, monitor your plants and destroy egg pods and nymphs.

• Monitor the field regularly for characteristic signs of the damage and the presence of grasshopper nymphs or adults.

• Pick adults directly from the foliage at night when they are sluggish. • In case of affected rice fields flood the

seedbed to drown the insect.

• Sweep small seedbeds with a net to catch the insect.

• Remove weeds which might serve as alternative hosts.

• Avoid frequent pesticide spray that could affect populations of beneficial insects..

• Deep ploughing after harvest is recommended in winter season to expose the egg masses to predators.

• Trenches of 45 cm deep and 30 cm wide may be dug across the front of marching hoppers and trenches should be provided 
with metal sheet barriers.

Treatement

We recommend following organic control methods in the early stages of a disease or when the crop is close to harvesting. 
In more advanced stages of a disease, please follow chemical control measures.

Mixing or applying different products at the same time is not recommended.

Organic Control

Biological control agents which occur naturally such as wasps, parasitic flies and worms, ants, birds, frogs, 
web-spinning spiders should be promoted. 
Fungal pathogens and entomopathogenic fungus (Metarhizium acridum) could also be used to reduce the population 
density of larvae. 
Use home-made poison baits from salt water and rice bran.

Chemical Control

Select and apply ONLY ONE of the following products to your crops.

What caused it?

The characteristic symptoms on leafs and panicles are caused by the nymphs and adults. 
Aquatic environments are suitable for their development (e.g. rice fields, floodplains, deltas). 
The grasshoppers range in sizes from 5 mm to 11 cm in length, and they could either be long and slender or short and 
stout. 
They can blend easily into their surroundings as they are either green or straw colored. 
Females lay yellow eggs on the foliage. The adults can develop wings, swarm and migrate.

{
Aphids(Insect)

Symptoms

• Curled and deformed leaves.

• Small insects under the leaves and shoots.

• Stunted growth.

Low to moderate numbers are usually not harmful to crops. 
Severe infestation can cause leaves and shoots to curl, wilt or yellow and stunt plant growth. 
A general decline in plant vigor will be noticed. 
Aphids produce honeydew that can cause an additional infection by opportunistic fungi, indicated by the development 
of mold on the leaves. The honeydew also attracts ants. 
Even small numbers of aphids can transmit viruses from plant to plant in a persistent way.

Preventive Measures

• Maintain a high number of different varieties of plants around fields.

• Remove plant debris from previous cultures.

• Use reflective mulches to repel invading populations of aphids.

• Monitor fields regularly to assess the incidence of a disease or pest and determine

their severity.

• Remove infected plant parts.

• Check weeds in and around the fields.

• Do not over-water or over-fertilize.

• Control ant populations that protect aphids with sticky bands.

• Prune the branches of your trees or remove the bottom leaves of your plants to favor the ventilation of the canopy.

• If possible, use nets to protect the plants.

• Control insecticide use in order not to affect beneficial insects.

Treatement

We recommend following organic control

methods in the early stages of a disease or

when the crop is close to harvesting. In more advanced stages of a disease, please follow chemical control measures. 
Mixing or applying different products at the same time is not recommended.

Organic Control

In case of mild infestation, use an insecticidal soap solution or solution based on plant oils, e.g. neem oil (3 ml/l). 
Aphids are also very susceptible to fungal diseases when it is humid. 
A spray of water on affected plants can also remove them.

Chemical Control

Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. 
Be aware that the use of chemical pesticides can cause aphids to become resistant to those that are used. 
Stem application with flonicamid and water (1:20) ratio at 30, 45, 60 days after sowing (DAS) can be planned. 
Fipronil 2 ml or thiamethoxam (0.2 g) or flonicamid (0.3 g) or acetamiprid (0.2 per liter of water) can also be used. 
However, these chemicals can have negative impacts on predators, parasitoids, and pollinators.

What caused it?

Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects with long legs and antennae. 
Their size ranges from 0.5 to 2 mm and the color of their body can be yellow, brown, red or black, depending on 
the species. 
Their aspect ranges from the wingless varieties, that are generally predominant, to the winged, waxy or woolly types.
Optimal conditions for their growth are dry and warm climates. 
They usually settle and feed in clusters on the underside of well-fed young leaves and shoot tips. 
They use their long mouth parts to pierce tender plant tissues and suck out fluids. 
After an initial invasion in late spring or early summer, the aphid population usually diminishes naturally due 
to natural enemies. 
Several species carry plant viruses that can lead to the development of other diseases.

Demerara Froghopper(Insect)

Symptoms

• Yellowing and wilting of leaves.

• White foamy liquid - 'spittle mass'.

• Dying of young plants.

Spittle- mass (a foamy liquid formed by the introduction of air into the watery excretion) is the most obvious evidence 
of feeding by nymphs on the plant. 
Female insect lays eggs in the soil near the host plants. 
After the eggs are hatched, nymphs begin to feed gregariously on roots and stems close to the soil surface. 
Both nymphs and adults suck on the sap and destroy the plants. 
The feeding by both nymphs and adults harm and debilitate the plants by sucking on them and injecting a toxin that 
blocks or prevents the circulation of the sap.

Preventive Measures

• Monitor the field for the presence of white foamy liquid on leaves (spittle mass).

• Control alternative hosts in and around the field.

Treatment

We recommend following organic control methods in the early stages of a disease or when the crop is close to harvesting. 
In more advanced stages of a disease, please follow

chemical control measures. Mixing or applying different products at the same time is not recommended.

Organic Control

Time available for hatching is significantly reduced with decreases in overnight temperature and the prolonged exposure 
of eggs to cold temperatures. This early hatching can reduce the populations of this insect.

Chemical Control

Always consider an integrated pest control program with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. 
Crop seeds could be treated with systematic insecticides to prevent the attack by Depois flavopicta.

What caused it?

The Demerara froghopper, also known as spittlebug (Depois flavopicta) is an insect that causes damage to several crops, 
among others rice and maize. 
Females lay eggs in the soil, close to the host plants. 
After hatching, the nymphs start to feed gregariously on roots and stems close to the soil surface. 
They form a "spittle mass", which is a white foamy liquid formed by the introduction of air bubbles into their own 
secretions. 
A spittle mass is an evidence of feeding by nymphs on the plant at that location. 
The presence of susceptible grasses in or around the fields (species of Brachiaria or Axonopus) can increase populations. 
They are attracted to these plants and use them as alternative host to support their life cycles.

{
Whitebacked Planthopper(Insect)

Symptoms

• Wilting of leaves.

- Stunted growth.

• Brown ears with rusty or black-cracked kernels.

• Reduced grain production.

• Dark planthopper with translucent forewings with dark mark at the tip.

Both nymphs and adults of the insect are found either at the base or on the upper part of the plants. 
The earliest signs are the wilting of leaves and stunting of plants due to the feeding activities on phloem sap and 
the damage of tissues which result in loss of water and nutrients. 
High population densities can lead to "hopperburn", i.e leaves progressively turn orange-yellow from the tip to the mid 
vein, then dry up and die. 
Plants are stunted, develop fewer tillers and may lodge. 
Insects can also attack panicles, resulting in brown ears, rusty or black-cracked kernels, and reduced grain production.

Preventive Measures

• Select resistant varieties at planting.

• Plant early to avoid peak populations or use early maturing varieties if available.

• Plant simultaneously with neighboring fields in order to break the life cycle of the pest.

• Split the application of nitrogen.

• Do not grow more than two crops per year. • Maintain fields free of rice or in fallow for a period of time.

· Drain the fields for 3 or 4 days twice during the growth season if heavy infestations occur.

• Avoid the use of broad scale insecticides as this can affect natural enemies.

Treatment

We recommend following organic control methods in the early stages of a disease or when the crop is close to harvesting. 
In more advanced stages of a disease, please follow chemical control measures.

Mixing or applying different products at the same time is not recommended.

Organic Control

Naturally-occurring biological control agents can normally keep populations of S. 
furcifera low. Predators include the mirid bug Cyrtorhinus lividipennis and some fairyflies of the genus Anagrus 
(A. flaveolus, A. perforator, A optabilis and A. frequens) that attack the eggs of the pest. 
There are also a number of predatory spiders that attack this pest, for example Lycosa pseudoannulata. 
Finally, the fungal pathogen Erynia delphacis can also help to reduce populations of the pest.

Chemical Control

Select and apply ONLY ONE of the following products to your crops.

Insecticide

Imidacloprid 17.8% SL

Found in Isogashi (IFFCO), Aalfidor (Agastya)

What caused it?

The damage is caused by the whitebacked planthopper, Sogatella furcifera. 
Adults are about 3 mm long, light brown to black, and have translucent forewings with a characteristic dark brown mark 
at the tip. 
This insect attacks preferably high yielding varieties. 
Its high reproductive potential and its migratory habits makes it a major pest of rice in East-Asia and Australia. 
It also transmits viruses in a persistent manner, for example the rice black streaked dwarf virus and the southern 
rice black-streaked dwarf virus. 
Planting time, the excessive use of nitrogen and the availability of water for irrigation affect the populations 
significantly. 
Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity or rainfall are also key drivers in its life cycle.

stackburn of rice(Fungus)

Symptoms

• Circular and oval spots with dark brown margins.

• Kernels may shrivel and become brittle.

• The whole plant shows a seedling blight and damping off.

Symptoms appear on leaves and ripening grains. 
Small dark lesions occur on the roots or the early leaves. 
Parts of the seedlings above lesions are blighted and may die. 
Circular to oval spots (3-10mm in diameter) with dark brown margins appear on the leaves. 
These larger spots show many light brown or white spots in the center. 
The kernels may shrivel and become brittle. 
Infected grain is usually dark colored, chalky, brittle and shriveled and reduced in viability. 
On the glumes reddish brown spots appear. The kernells may shrivel and become brittle.

Preventive Measures

• Plant disease-free seeds.

• Practice row spacing (15, 20 and 25 cm wide).

• Use only tested and certified rice seed to prevent the importation of this seed borne pathogen into new areas, 
or the increase of innoculum in already infested areas.

• Burn the stubbles to reduce the infection for the next season.

• Properly dry the grain before storage to

reduce later development of infection.

Treatement
We recommend following organic control methods in the early stages of a disease or when the crop is close to harvesting. 
In more advanced stages of a disease, please follow chemical control measures.

Mixing or applying different products at the same time is not recommended.

Organic Control

Treat seeds with Thiram, Captan or Mancozeb at 2g/kg. Treat seeds with hot water at 54°C for 15 minutes for best results 
for germination and disinfection. 
Burn the stubbles and straw in the field. 
Apply a formulation of rice rhizosphere inhabiting bacteria called pseudomonas flourescens, in powdered talc at the rates
of 5 and 10 per kg.

Chemical Control

Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available.

Use fungicide sprays of Chlorothalonil, Mancozeb, Carboxin, Polyoxin and Iprobenfos to control grain discoloration.

What caused it?

The disease is caused by the seed-borne fungus of T. Padwickii, an asexually-reproducing fungus that infects. 
seeds of rice. 
It is responsible for seed discoloration, seed rot and seedling blight.. It's occurrence has been recorded primarily 
in tropical regions. 
Humidity and high temperatures are conducive to the growth of the fungi. 
The fungi can survive as sclerotia in plant debris and soil.
